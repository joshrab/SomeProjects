# TerribleProjects
No description necessary. Pretty self explanatory.

  1. Basically, first project I'll make here is a basic calculator. I don't yet know how to incorporate that into an app,
  but if its cheap and easy I'll definitely try!  And if coding that in Java goes successfully, I'll try it in JavaScript
  or C++ or something new, ya know? Just to practice.
